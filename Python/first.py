my_name = "Pulkit"
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + " !!")

num = 5
print(num ** 2) # ** means power

print(my_name[0]) # index 0 output so it will be P
print(my_name[-3]) # index -3 output so it will be K...whn we go negative index it goes to the bck of the string and last character becomes -1 second last is -2 and then so on
print(my_name[0:4]) # This will print the character from index 0 to 3 ( Cz it excludes the num u enter as the end so if u want 1st 4 then put the end as 5)
print(my_name[0:]) # It has default value for end which is the length of the string
print(my_name[:5]) # It has default value for start which is 0
print(my_name[:]) # This will print the whole string cz default for start is 0 and end is the length
